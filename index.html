	<p>
	Life Saver Training, Inc. was founded by Matthew Arpino in 2014. Matthew became a volunteer EMT in 2010 and while volunteering, he took the opportunity to become an AHA BLS CPR Instructor. Matthew fell in love with teaching and decided to start teaching CPR & First Aid to small groups. Today, the company now trains large universities and businesses.
	
	As a healthcare training provider, we offer CPR, First Aid, and other health-related training through the American Heart Association (AHA), American Red Cross (ARC), and the American Safety and Health Institute (ASHI) to the community and workplace-based rescuers. We also provide NYS Defensive Driving Courses through the American Safety Council. We provide an exceptional learning experience through our state-of-the-art equipment and competent instructors.
